# Old MATSim playgrounds

MATSim playgrounds were private projects of MATSIM developers. They were used for an easier re-factoring when the MATSim API was not as stable as today. Playgrounds were removed in 2018. Repositories of the main MATSim groups may be found at
* [MATSim-vsp](https://github.com/matsim-vsp) for the group around Kai Nagel in Berlin
* [MATSim-eth](https://github.com/matsim-eth) for the group around Kay Axhausen in Zurich
* [MATSim-up](https://github.com/matsim-up) for the group around Johan Joubert in Pretoria
* [MATSim SBB](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/matsim-sbb-extensions) for extensions developed by the Swiss Federal Railways
